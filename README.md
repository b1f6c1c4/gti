ivm
===

Just a silly `vim` launcher, basically. Inspired by `gti` and `sl`.

Build and Install
-----------------

From source:

    $ make
    $ make install # as root, probably

The default install PREFIX is `/usr/bin`.

You can change the speed of the car at runtime via `IVM_SPEED`.
For example:

    $ IVM_SPEED=2000 ivm .vimrc # default is 1000

Usage
-----

Try typing `vim` really fast, on an unfamiliar keyboard.
