Hey, I just wanted to say everything works fantastically.

Not sure why I even opened this issue.


I'm using `ivm` on
* [ ] HP-UX running on a 68k
* [ ] NetBSD, with output piped to a slice of toast
* [ ] an unreleased beta version of Windows NT 4.0 with a cmd.exe replacement from ReactOS


and it
* [ ] set fire to my line printer
* [ ] hard-linked `/bin/emacs` to`/bin/vi`
* [ ] crashes when run backwards in my home-grown CPU emulator
